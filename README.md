This is a simple personal website I created as part of my learning journey.  
It showcases some basic HTML, CSS, and Flask integration to build a clean, navigable site.

The website currently includes sections like About Me, Projects, and Contact.  
It’s designed to be easily expandable with new features and content in the future.

I didn’t face major difficulties even though I was new to CSS, and this project was a great start for building my first website.
